# Sustainability
To ensure a sustainable project, we've taken advantage of different techniques.

### Images only
By only having images, and not including GIFs or videos, we reduce the amount of energy and datatraffic required by using our website.

### Caching
When the website performs API queries, we utilize caching to reduce the amount of traffic required to perform the functionality that the website offers the user. We utilize caching in a multitude of files, but two examples of where it is used are for favourites and reviews.

### Pagination
By utilizing pagination we reduce the length of travel on the website. This reduces the amount of data being transferred and ensures a good user experience.

### Breadcrumb
By including a breadcrumb, our website is easier to access and navigate. This makes it easier for the user to back to where they came from, and gives them a better overview of their progress when navigating through the website.
