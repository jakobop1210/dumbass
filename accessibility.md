# Accessibility

To ensure universal accessibility we have implemented several features.

### Semantic HTML
Semantic HTML provides meaningful structure to our website. This makes it easier to navigate and understand for people with disabilities, especially for those using technology that assists them.

### Navigation with tab
To make our website navigable and functional only using a keyboard, we have implemented Tab key navigation. This ensures that people without a mouse can use our website with all its functionality.
