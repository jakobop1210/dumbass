# Accessibility

To ensure universal accessibility we have implemented several features.

## Semantic HTML

Semantic HTML provides meaningful structure to our website. This makes it easier to navigate and understand for people with disabilities, especially for those using technology that assists them.

## Navigation with tab

To make our website navigable and functional only using a keyboard, we have implemented Tab key navigation. This ensures that people without a mouse can use our website with all its functionality. To enhance this functionality, focus indicators are crucial. These indicators visibly highlight the element currently selected by the keyboard, aiding users in understanding which part of the website they're interacting with. This visual cue is particularly helpful for those who cannot use a mouse and rely solely on the keyboard.

## Contrast in colors

We've utilized a color palette with big contrasts between important objects on the screen. By having a light background and dark text color, we're making sure people who struggle with color blindness can fully enjoy the website.

## Breadcrumbs

Our breadcrumb component works as an effective navigational aid, providing users with a clear understanding of their location within our website's hierarchy. This feature allows users to easily trace their steps back through the website, enhancing the user experience by offering a straightforward method to navigate complex sites or large amounts of content.

## UX and UI design

Our prioritizing a user-friendly design in both UX and UI ensures that our website is intuitive and easy to use. This involved creating a layout that is simple to navigate, with clear headings, readable fonts, and logical flow of content. Such a design reduces cognitive load and makes the website accessible to users of all skill levels.

## User feedback

Our wevsite provide immediate feedback on user actions. This is vital for a seamless user experience. This includes confirmation popups for successful actions and error messages for unsuccessful ones. Such feedback ensures that users are always aware of the result of their interactions, making the website more reliable and user-friendly.

## Responsiveness

Our website has a responsive design that adapts to various screen sizes and supports text zooming. This feature ensures that our website is easily accessible on different devices, from desktops to smartphones, and is usable for people with visual impairments who need larger text to read comfortably.
